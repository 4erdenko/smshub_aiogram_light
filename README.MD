# SMSHub-API-Telegram-Bot

This project demonstrates a Telegram Bot designed to interact with the smshub.org API for managing phone numbers. It provides a simple and convenient interface for viewing balance, buying numbers, and managing status (cancellation, getting a new code, finishing the number). It is implemented using Python, aiogram, and asyncio.

## Features

- Get balance from your smshub.org account.
- Buy phone numbers from various services.
- Cancel numbers, get new codes, and finish numbers.
- Convenient user interface using Telegram Bot.
- Restrict access to the bot only to your own Telegram ID.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.8 or later to run the bot. You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

In Ubuntu, Mint, and Debian you can install Python like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

For other Linux flavors, macOS, and Windows, packages are available at

http://www.python.org/getit/

### Quick Start

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smshub-api-telegram-bot.git
cd smshub-api-telegram-bot
```

Create a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file and update the content:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```bash
SMSHUB_API=your_sms_hub_api_key
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
MY_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
SERVICES_DICT='{"ServiceName1": "code1", "ServiceName2": "code2", ...}'
```

To get your Telegram Chat ID, you can use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram. Simply forward a message to this bot, and it will reply with the user info, including the Chat ID.

### Running the Bot

To start the bot, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Now, you can go to your Telegram App and interact with your bot.

## Usage

- Use `/start` command to initiate interaction with the bot.
- Click on '💵 Balance' to get the balance from your smshub.org account.
- Click on '📞 Buy number' to buy a phone number from a list of available services.
- When a number is bought, you can click 'Cancel' to cancel the number, 'Get new code' to get a new code for the number, and 'Finish' to mark the number as finished.
